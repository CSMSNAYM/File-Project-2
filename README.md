Hello, I am Subhan Naymi and i am going to explain how you can run my code without any errors, 
First once you have opened my githb repository open the file-project-2 folder, it will contain this README document a license document and my code for my visualisation, called SubhanNaymi-MyVisualisation-Feature, open it then it should show my code for my visualisation, Question B 'What is the yearly inflation rate of Vegetable' once you have the code accessed you can use this repo in Microsoft VS code to run it and test the programme, the repo should contain the dataset file and other files, IMPORTANT things to note is that all python extensions must be downloaded, the ananconda interpreter which is the one i used and any recommomended extensions for VS Code after all this is check marked the code should run within the application smoothly with the visualisations showing once ran.
